Inventory and Chauffeur Management System
This Java project implements an inventory tracking system and a chauffeur-driven rental company (CDRC) management system using binary search trees (BSTs). The project covers two main functionalities: managing inventory and managing chauffeur information.

Features:

Inventory Tracking System:

Binary Search Tree Implementation: Efficiently manages inventory using BST.
Operations:
addProduct: Adds a new product to the inventory.
isAvailable: Checks if a product is available and retrieves its stock quantity.
Quit: Terminates the program.
Chauffeur Management System:

Binary Search Tree Implementation: Manages chauffeur data with BST.
Operations:
addCaptain: Adds a new chauffeur to the database.
deleteCaptain: Removes a chauffeur from the database.
displayCaptain: Displays information about a specific chauffeur.
displayAllCaptains: Lists all chauffeurs in the database.
checkAvailability: Checks the availability status of a chauffeur.
finish: Updates the chauffeur's status after a ride is completed.
Quit: Terminates the program.
Implementation Details:

Binary Search Tree (BST): Utilized for efficient data management and retrieval.
Input Handling: Uses BufferedReader for reading input from text files and processes data accordingly.
Exception Handling: Includes mechanisms to handle and report exceptional cases.
Testing:

Comprehensive testing was conducted to ensure functionality and correctness.
Input handling and output formatting were tested to match expected results.
Final Assessments:

Developed a robust BST-based system for managing inventory and chauffeur information.
Gained experience in handling input from files and implementing algorithms for data management.
